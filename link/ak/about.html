   <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Atul Kochhar (born 31 August 1969) is an Indian born, British based chef, 
	restaurateur and television personality. Atul is one of the most critically 
	acclaimed chefs in Britain for his take on modern Indian cuisine. Atul was 
	the first Indian chef to receive a Michelin star, which he maintained with 
	the opening of his first solo venture- Benares restaurant in London in 2007. 
	Atul regularly appears on television shows including Masterchef Goes Large 
	and Great British Menu. He is also a regular guest on BBC’s Saturday Kitchen 
	and in 2010 launched his own series: Atul’s Spice Kitchen: Malaysia.</p>
	<p>In 2008 Atul opened his first restaurant in Ireland, Ananda – meaning 
	eternal joy –in the Dundrum Town Centre on the outskirts of Dublin. That 
	year he also opened Vatika Restaurant located in Southampton situated on 
	Wickham Vineyard. Just an hour from London, the team at Vatika focuses on 
	serving cutting edge cuisine using locally sourced and freshly prepared 
	ingredients which gives rise to modern British food with a unique Indian twist. 
	In September 2011 Vatika closed and Atul is currently looking at locations to 
	reopen Vatika in London.</p>
	<p>Atul also has a restaurant's on P&O’s cruise ships, Sindhu aboard the Azura 
	cruise ship and more recently East aboard Ventura. Sindhu is one of Azura’s 
	three select dining restaurants and the name signifies the river Indus, and is 
	sometimes taken to mean "meeting point" or "fusion" in Hindi. Atul said that 
	launching a restaurant aboard a P&O ship was a "Dream come true. My restaurant 
	on Azura will be called Sindhu, and that’s what my cuisine is, an amalgamation 
	of British and Indian, so it’s just the right name. I’m a great believer that 
	good food is often simple food, so that will be the best thing to give". The 
	on-board restaurant celebrates Britain’s love of Indian food and P&O Cruises 
	long-standing affiliation with India. Diners are able to sample a fusion of 
	British and Indian cuisine whilst watching chefs in action in the theatre style 
	galley. The venue will have two different areas – a bar for pre-dinner drinks 
	and light meals in the main restaurant. Kochhar spends a minimum of 20 days a 
	year aboard the ship and overseeing the restaurant.</p>
	<p>Atul’s recipes have appeared widely in magazines and newspapers, and he 
	demonstrates regularly on food shows in the UK and abroad. He currently has 
	three books published including his debut book, Indian Essence (published by Quadrille in 2004) 
	and his second book Fish, Indian Style (published by Absolute Press in 2008). Atul released his 
	third book, Curries of the World, in March 2013.Atul has also been featured in Great 
	British Menu Cookbook (Dorling Kindersley Publishers Ltd in 2007).</p>
